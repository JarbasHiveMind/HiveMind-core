# HiveMind Core

HiveMind is a flexible [protocol](https://jarbashivemind.github.io/HiveMind-community-docs/04_protocol/) that
facilitates communication and collaboration among devices and AI agents within a
unified network. It enables lightweight devices, called **satellites**, to connect to a central hub, with customizable
permissions and centralized control.

HiveMind also
supports [hierarchical hub-to-hub connections](https://jarbashivemind.github.io/HiveMind-community-docs/15_nested/),
creating powerful,
scalable smart environments.

Initially developed as part of the [OpenVoiceOS (OVOS)](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/) ecosystem, HiveMind is
adaptable to various AI backend systems.

## üåü Key Features

- **Modular Design**: Easily extend functionality with plugins for different protocols and behaviors.
- **Protocol Flexibility**: Use HiveMind with different **network**, **agent**, and **binary protocols**.
- **Customizable Database Options**: Support for JSON, SQLite, and Redis.
- **Centralized Control**: Manage and monitor devices from a single hub.
- **[Fine-Grained Permissions](https://jarbashivemind.github.io/HiveMind-community-docs/16_permissions/)**: Control
  access to skills, intents, and message types for each satellite.
- **Multi-Agent Support**: Integrate various AI assistants, such as [OpenVoiceOS](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/)
  or [LLMs](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-persona).

---

## üîå Modular Design with Plugins

HiveMind is designed to be modular, allowing you to customize its behavior through plugins managed by the **HiveMind
Plugin Manager**.

- **Transport Mechanism** üöö: The protocol does not specify **how** messages are transported; this is implemented via **network protocol plugins**.
- **Payload Handling** ü§ñ : The protocol does not dictate **who** handles the messages; this is implemebted via **agent protocol plugins**.
- **Message Format** üì¶: The protocol supports **JSON data** modeled after the `Message` [structure from OVOS](https://jarbashivemind.github.io/HiveMind-community-docs/13_mycroft/) and **binary** data; what happens to the received binary data is implemented via **binary data protocol plugins**.
- **Database**: üóÉÔ∏è how client credentials are stored is implemented via **database plugins**

## üìñ Anatomy of a HiveMind Server

In addition to implementing the [hivemind protocol](https://jarbashivemind.github.io/HiveMind-community-docs/04_protocol/), a HiveMind server uses configurable plugins for other key components:

1. **Database**: Stores client credentials and settings (e.g., JSON, SQLite, Redis).
2. **Network Protocol**: Determines how devices connect to the server (e.g., Websockets, HTTP).
3. **Agent Protocol**: Defines how the server processes and responds to messages (e.g., OVOS, Persona).
4. **Binary Protocol**: Specifies what to do you the received binary data (e.g., process incoming audio).

Each component can be extended or replaced using plugins, providing unparalleled flexibility for your specific use case.

### Protocol Configuration

HiveMind Core now supports a configuration file, making it easier for users to define server settings and reduce the need for complex command-line arguments. 

> üí° The configuration file is stored at `~/.config/hivemind-core/server.json`

The default configuration

```json
{
  "agent_protocol": {
    "module": "hivemind-ovos-agent-plugin",
    "hivemind-ovos-agent-plugin": {
      "host": "127.0.0.1",
      "port": 8181
    }
  },
  "binary_protocol": {
    "module": null
  },
  "network_protocol": {
    "module": "hivemind-websocket-plugin",
    "hivemind-websocket-plugin": {
      "host": "0.0.0.0",
      "port": 5678,
      "ssl": false,
      "cert_dir": "/path/to/xdg/data/hivemind",
      "cert_name": "hivemind"
    }
  },
  "database": {
    "module": "hivemind-json-db-plugin",
    "hivemind-json-db-plugin": {
      "name": "clients",
      "folder": "hivemind-core"
    }
  }
}
```

## üõ∞Ô∏è  Quick Start

To get started, HiveMind Core provides a command-line interface (CLI) for managing clients, permissions, and
connections.

### Installation

```bash
pip install hivemind-core
```

### Adding a Satellite

Add credentials for each satellite device:

```bash
$ hivemind-core add-client --db-backend sqlite 
Database backend: SQLiteDB
Credentials added to database!

Node ID: 3
Friendly Name: HiveMind-Node-2
Access Key: 42caf3d2405075fb9e7a4e1ff44e4c4f
Password: 5ae486f7f1c26bd4645bd052e4af3ea3
Encryption Key: f46351c54f61a715
WARNING: Encryption Key is deprecated, only use if your client does not support password
```

**NOTE**: You will need to provide this information on the client devices to connect.

### Running the Server

Start the HiveMind Core server to accept connections:

```bash
$ hivemind-core listen
```

---

### `delete-client`

Remove a registered client from the HiveMind instance.

```bash
$ hivemind-core delete-client 1
```

- **When to use**:  
  Use this command to revoke a client‚Äôs access, for example, when a device is lost, no longer in use, or compromised.

---

### `allow-msg`

By default only some messages are allowed, extra messages can be allowed per client

Allow specific message types to be sent by a client.

```bash
$ hivemind-core allow-msg "speak"
```

- **When to use**:  
  Use this command to enable certain message types, particularly when extending a client‚Äôs communication capabilities (
  e.g., allowing TTS commands).

---

### `blacklist-msg`

Revoke specific message types from being allowed to be sent by a client.

```bash
$ hivemind-core blacklist-msg "speak"
```

- **When to use**:  
  Use this command to prevent specific message types from being sent by a client, adding a layer of control over
  communication.

---

### `blacklist-skill`

Prevent a specific skill from being triggered by a client.

```bash
$ hivemind-core blacklist-skill "skill-weather" 1
```

- **When to use**:  
  Use this command to restrict a client‚Äôs access to particular skills, such as preventing a device from accessing
  certain skills for safety or appropriateness.

---

### `allow-skill`

Remove a skill from a client‚Äôs blacklist, allowing it to be triggered.

```bash
$ hivemind-core allow-skill "skill-weather" 1
```

- **When to use**:  
  If restrictions on a skill are no longer needed, use this command to reinstate access to the skill.

---

### `blacklist-intent`

Block a specific intent from being triggered by a client.

```bash
$ hivemind-core blacklist-intent "intent.check_weather" 1
```

- **When to use**:  
  Use this command to block a specific intent from being triggered by a client. This is useful for managing permissions
  in environments with shared skills.

---

### `allow-intent`

Remove a specific intent from a client‚Äôs blacklist.

```bash
$ hivemind-core allow-intent "intent.check_weather" 1
```

- **When to use**:  
  Use this command to re-enable access to previously blocked intents, restoring functionality for the client.

---

### `listen`

Start the HiveMind instance to listen for client connections.

```bash
$ hivemind-core listen
```

- **When to use**:  
  Use this command to start the HiveMind instance, enabling it to accept connections from clients (e.g., satellite
  devices). Configure the host, port, and security options as needed.
