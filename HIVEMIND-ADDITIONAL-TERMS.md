# Additional Terms for HiveMind-core

These Additional Terms supplement the GNU AGPL-3.0 license for the HiveMind-core project.  
They do not limit or reduce the rights granted by the AGPL with respect to the HiveMind-core source code itself.  
They apply to works and assets that are *not covered* by the AGPL, including but not limited to:  
protocol definitions, documentation, trademarks, compatibility labels, and certification marks.

These terms exist to ensure fair use, to protect project identity, and to support the long-term sustainability of HiveMind-core development.

---

## 1. Definitions

**HiveMind-core**  
The reference implementation of the HiveMind protocol, licensed under the GNU AGPL-3.0.

**HiveMind Protocol**  
The network protocol, message schemas, and normative definitions published by the project.

**Commercial Deployment**  
Use of HiveMind-core or the HiveMind Protocol in any product, service, internal tooling, or platform that is offered commercially or used in the course of commercial activity.

**Derivative Work**  
As defined by the AGPL-3.0. For avoidance of doubt, any module, extension, or plugin executed by the HiveMind-core runtime is considered a derivative work.

---

## 2. Protocol Usage Terms

The HiveMind Protocol is copyrighted material that is separate from the HiveMind-core implementation.

Commercial Deployment of software or services that implement the HiveMind Protocol requires a **commercial protocol license**, except where such software qualifies for a no-cost license (see section 5).

Non-commercial and open-source projects may implement the HiveMind Protocol freely, provided that they:

- do not use the HiveMind name or trademark in a misleading or commercial context;
- do not claim official compatibility or certification without written permission.

---

## 3. Use of HiveMind-core in Bundled or Distributed Systems

If HiveMind-core is redistributed as part of a software bundle (including Docker Compose, Helm charts, VM images, or appliance-style distributions), the distributor must:

1. Provide a clear and accessible link to the HiveMind-core source code,
2. Provide access to the AGPL license text,
3. Not modify HiveMind-core in a way that violates AGPL obligations.

Distribution does *not* allow the distributor to use HiveMind trademarks, compatibility labels, or certification indicators without a trademark license (see Trademark Terms).

---

## 4. Official Compatibility and Certification

Use of any of the following requires a commercial or written no-cost license:

- “HiveMind Compatible”
- “Powered by HiveMind”
- “HiveMind Certified”
- The HiveMind logo or word mark in marketing, sales, or product materials.

These marks are controlled separately from the AGPL and are not granted under open-source terms.

---

## 5. No-Cost License for Nonprofits and Open-Source Projects

A no-cost commercial license is available for:

- Non-profit and educational organizations
- Open-source projects released under a permissive license (MIT, BSD, Apache-2.0)
- Research projects that make their integrations publicly available

Projects qualifying for this category must contact the maintainer for verification.

---

## 6. Prohibited Uses Without Commercial License

Without a commercial license, you may not:

- Use HiveMind-core or the HiveMind Protocol in proprietary platforms or marketplaces
- Operate SaaS or PaaS offerings built on HiveMind-core
- Embed HiveMind-core in closed-source industrial systems
- Distribute commercial appliances or bundles in which HiveMind-core is an essential component
- Claim compatibility or certification

A commercial license removes these restrictions.

---

## 7. Reservation of Rights

All rights not expressly granted remain reserved by the project maintainer.  

These Additional Terms may be updated; users should consult the latest version when deploying commercially.
