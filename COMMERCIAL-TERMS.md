# HiveMind Commercial Policy & Additional Terms

These terms supplement the **GNU AGPL-3.0** license for **HiveMind-core**.

* The **Source Code** is governed by the **GNU AGPL-3.0**.
* The **Trademarks, Logos, and Brand Identity** are governed by this Policy.
* **Commercial Licenses** (exceptions to the AGPL) are governed by a separate agreement.

These terms exist to ensure the sustainability of the project, protect its identity, and clarify the maintainer's interpretation of "Combined Works" in commercial distributions.

## 1. Trademark & Branding Restrictions

**The GNU AGPL-3.0 does NOT grant rights to use the project’s trademarks.**

The names **"HiveMind"**, **"HiveMind-core"**, **"HiveMind Protocol"**, and the project logos are the exclusive property of the maintainer.

### You require a Commercial Trademark License if you:
* Market a product, service, or platform using the name "HiveMind" (e.g., "HiveMind Powered", "HiveMind Compatible").
* Use the HiveMind logo in commercial presentations, "White Label" stores, or marketing materials.
* Claim official compatibility or certification in a commercial context.

**Fair Use Exception:** You may use the name solely for factual identification (e.g., *"This device runs a modified version of HiveMind-core"*), provided such use does not imply endorsement or commercial affiliation.

---

## 2. Commercial & Closed-Source Licensing

To use **HiveMind-core** in a proprietary (closed-source) environment where compliance with the AGPL-3.0 is not possible or desired, you must obtain a **Commercial License**.

A Commercial License provides:
* **Exemption from AGPL-3.0 obligations** (allowing proprietary derivatives and closed-source modifications).
* **Right to use Trademarks** in your product branding and marketing.
* **Professional Support** and warranty options.

**Contact:** `jarbasai@mailfence.com` for licensing inquiries.

## 3. Project Interpretation of AGPL Obligations

To ensure clarity for commercial integrators, the maintainer adheres to the following interpretations of the AGPL-3.0 regarding **"Combined Works"** and **"Network Interaction"**.

### A. Bundled Distributions & "Stacks"
If you distribute **HiveMind-core** as part of a software bundle (e.g., Docker Compose stack, VM image, hardware appliance) alongside proprietary "skills," "plugins," or "extensions" that are:
1.  **Functionally dependent** on HiveMind-core to operate, AND
2.  **Intimately coupled** via internal protocols or shared runtime logic,

The project considers this a **Combined Work**. Under the AGPL, the source code for the *entire combination* (including proprietary skills) must be made available to users.

**Commercial Note:** If you cannot open-source your proprietary skills/plugins, you must purchase a Commercial License to distribute this stack.

### B. Network Interaction (SaaS / IoT)
Per **AGPL Section 13**, if users interact with HiveMind-core remotely through a computer network (e.g., via a mobile app, web dashboard, or factory control system), you must provide those users access to the Corresponding Source Code.

* This applies even if the software is "deployed" rather than "distributed."
* This applies to any modified versions or "Combined Works" running on your servers/devices.

---

## 4. No-Cost Commercial License

A no-cost Commercial License (including Trademark rights) is available for:
* **Non-Profit Organizations** (registered NGOs, charities).
* **Strictly Open-Source Projects** (released under OSI-approved permissive licenses like BSD/Apache-2.0).
* **Academic Research** (where results are published openly).

*Note: Projects funded by commercial grants that result in proprietary or "exploitation-ready" products **do not** qualify for the no-cost license.*
